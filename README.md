Types:
* `Math.ValueCategory`: Categories given by a type of objects and a type of morphisms
* `Math.ValueCategory.Arrow`: The arrow category of a given category
* `Math.ValueCategory.Sequential`: Sequences of objects indexed by the natural numbers
* `Math.ValueCategory.Abelian`: Categories whose homsets are abelian groups, and whose morphisms have well-behaved kernels and cokernels.
* `Math.ValueCategory.Effective`: Objects in an abelian category presented as the colimit of a sequence.

* `Math.Algebra.AbGroup`: F.g. abelian groups and their abelian category structure.
