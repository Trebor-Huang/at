-- | The bar construction of a DG-algebra \(A\), specifically,
-- \(Bar(ℤ,A,ℤ)\).  The bar construction of an ordinary algebra is a
-- special case (sometimes called the 'standard complex').
--
-- There are many resources that describe this bar construction. For
-- example, see Section 2.2.2 in
-- <http://math.uchicago.edu/~may/REU2019/REUPapers/Zhang,Ruoqi(Rachel).pdf>.
-- Also <https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/bar+and+cobar+construction>,
-- and Homology, MacLane, Chapter X.10 (Kenzo claims there is a sign
-- error)
--
-- For the commutative algebra structure see for example
-- <https://doi.org/10.1023/A:1013544506151>
--
-- To reduce the surface area of where sign issues can creep in, the
-- construction is factored into two steps:
-- Alg(Z) -Bar-> biCh(Z) -Tot-> Ch(Z)
module Math.Algebra.ChainComplex.Algebra.Bar where

-- There are lots of places that the signs can go wrong.
--
-- Whatever we do should end up compatible with the sign choices made
-- by Kenzo, so we can confirm things are going right.
--
-- TODO: compare sign choices with
-- https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~tlawson/papers/signs.pdf
-- Not promising: "This brings us to a dear friend whose sign
-- conventions have personally given me nightmares on more than one
-- occasion. Namely, the bar construction — or specifically, in this
-- case, the bar construction of a differential graded algebra with
-- coefficients in a pair of differential graded modules. "
